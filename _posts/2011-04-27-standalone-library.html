A little history and an update: after <a href="http://www.infoether.com">Rich Kilmer</a> integrated my graphics library into Apple's MacRuby project as part of the "HotCocoa" library, the HotCocoa project was split out from MacRuby into its own gem at <a href="https://github.com/richkilmer/hotcocoa">github.com/richkilmer/hotcocoa</a>. Then, <a href="http://merbist.com">Matt Aimonetti</a> extracted the graphics library out of HotCocoa into its OWN standalone library, MacRuby Graphics.  Here's my fork of that project, where future development efforts will be directed:  <a href="https://github.com/drtoast/macruby_graphics">github.com/drtoast/macruby_graphics</a>
